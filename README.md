# Beurling Factorization of Hardy Spaces
Hello! This is my masters report presentation that I presented on May 15th 2023. I studied [Hardy spaces on the disk and the circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy_space) and the [Beurling Factorization of Hardy spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy_space#Factorization_into_inner_and_outer_functions). My masters' advisor was [Dr. Md. Ramiz Reza](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/faculty/ramiz/personal-information).

Here's [the final report](https://github.com/ashishKujur7/BeurlingFactorizationHardySpaces/blob/main/innerOuterFactorization.pdf).
